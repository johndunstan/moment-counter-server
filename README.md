# Moment Counter Server

Backend for the [Moment Counter](https://github.com/johndunstan/moment-counter) project I created during [Nucamp](https://www.nucamp.co/).

## Tech Stack

NodeJs server using Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose

## Intro

Maybe it seemed obvious, but I didn't fully get the message that our backend project should ideally work with our frontend project and not necessarily be something new and unique. ðŸ¤¦

So I'm pivoting to doing a backend that matches with my frontend project rather than the virtual bookshelf idea (which seemed a bit more interesting as far as backend goes).

With that said, I'll start working on an idea of adding some backend functionality to my frontend project: [Moment Counter](https://github.com/johndunstan/moment-counter).

In my original state design of Moment Counter, I set state up to handle multiple lists with a bit data than complete/notComplete. So hopefully that'll keep the backend a bit more interesting.

## Design

### Details

_Give the details of your REST API, the various REST API end points and the operations to be supported on these end points._

#### /lists

Endpoint for all the created lists

##### get

Returns all the lists

#### post

Creates a new list of lists (basically a new user)

#### put

Not supported?

#### delete

Deletes all lists

#### /lists/:listId

A specific list for a user - would have a unique name and a collection of items

##### get

Returns a list including its name and collections of items

#### post

Creates a new list

#### put

Updates a list (either name or total items)

#### delete

Deletes the desired list

### /lists/:listId/:itemId

The specific item in a list. Curently has an isComplete property, but I would like to expand to include description, date, time, and duration.

##### get

Returns info on the specific item

#### post

Not supported (a different fuction should add items to the list?)

#### put

Updates a specific list-item (at this post likely changing the bool value of isComplete)

#### delete

Removes a specific item from the list

### Schemas, Design, and Structure

_Give any details of the database schema and the structure of your database storage (documents etc.)._

I'm still learning the terms, but my database should have a document that a list of lists. Each list will contain items. Each item will have various properties.

#### List of Lists

Will contain all the lists. Eventually, if users are implemented, each user would have their own List of Lists.

#### List

A list will essentially serve as a container for items. It's primary value is to be able to be named (e.g. 'Pushups to Complete', 'Poms', 'Glasses of Water').

##### listSchema

```
name: string, required, unique
```

#### Items

Items will initially have only a isComplete property that is usable. However, I plan to have the schema also include properties for description, date, time, and duration. Initially those values will simply be null.

##### itemSchema

```
isComplete: bool, required
descirption: string
date: date
time: time
duration: number
```

### Communication

_Give the structure of the messages to be communicated between the front-end and the back-end._

I'm not sure I fully understand

## Conclusions

## References

_Give references to any material / websites / books etc. relevant to your project_
